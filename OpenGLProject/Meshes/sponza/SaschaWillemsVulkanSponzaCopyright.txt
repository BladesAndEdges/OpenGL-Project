The textures used for the sponza (Excluding the 8x8 pixel files I created myself)
come from two sources. Most of them are the original files accompanying the 
Crytek Sponza model. However, some of them were created by Sascha Willems, 
and some modifications were made to certain files. These changes made are 
declared below, and the links to the original copyright files is there, as well.

The changes I did to these files is use an online converter to simply change 
the files from it's original format of .dds to .png, which is what I wished to
use in the project.

Changes by me (Sascha Willems) for use in a Vulkan demo:
- Converted to a blender scene file (and exported to a collada .dae)
	- Added normal and specular maps
	- Set alpha flags to easily distinguish transparent mats in loader
- Created normal maps for several surfaces that were lacking them
- Converted all files to dds format (BC2)
